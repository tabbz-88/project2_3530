This is a bare bones data structure with both the scientific names and common names for 2.3 billion(?) species. The program has a very, very simple design and a simple Least Common Ancestor finder.
The Data Structure (possibly for now) takes a tree of linked taxonomy, in the .tsv, and puts it in an unordered map, stored like a tree.
We only have 1 algorithm right now, which is just a simple linear comparison based on the taxonomy ancestors.
It should compute the relation between two species and give their least common ancestor.

Usage:
g++ main.cpp Taxon.cpp CommonName.cpp Relation.cpp -o relation
run relation.exe

Wait for the program to load the datasets.
Input species 1 and species 2 or common names.
It should return the relatedness percentage and the lca.
If its invalid, relaunch relation.exe (I tested it with human and chimpanzee). It currently doesnt ask for the name again, added to TO-DO.

Currently names with spaces is bugged (i.e. Great White Shark; will return invalid). Names like "human" and "chimpanzee" works (should give a relation value of 89%).
The current computational algorithm to find the least common ancestor might also be off. This is what I would work on the most while also working on a second algorithm to compare.
Currently, there is no timing to return the time it took to find the lca, but the function itself should be O(n) worst case.

It's way too big to upload to github for right now. Drop the two tsv files into the Project 2 folder.
I couldn't get the API to work, so if you guys figure it out and implements it, it will be very helpful.

Documentation for the dataset:
https://www.checklistbank.org/about/formats#data-content

TO-DO:
- Timing the algorithm
- Implement multiple algorithms to compare
- Implement actual name validations and possibly even autofill
  - Preferably you would type in the name on the web, and then there would be a drop down list of matching names.
- Implement web app
  - and all the functions for it
- Try to get the tsv files to be included in the repository somehow
- return the path of ancestors between two species
- Debug everything

Download the ZIP and compile.
* I am using VSCode and Windows, I am not sure if it works on CLion or Linux.
